A Towerful of Mice

Category: Haunted Tower
Time of day: any
How often can it happen?: once
Frequency (xx/100): 2
Location: Forest

Description: The party see a ferry at the edge of a misty swamp. It leads into the swamp. 

If they step into it and ferry across they arrive at a small walled and partially flooded island. There are old and rotten boats around it. Some corpses lay on the island with groups of black flies on them (can attack players), ghosts of inhabitants discuss the horrible lord of the tower who does not share his hoarded food. They went there to remove him from power and get his food but on their way out they died of poison released from the tower. Around the tower are some drowners (adaptation of zombies, corpses of the villagers come to life) who fight the party.

When the party enters the tower they can do a check on the door to see the poison trap (see poison trap near bottom). Inside see lots of rats (pack of rats attacks), in the basement there are crates and barrels where mice have eaten their way inside. Near the top a hidden lever opens a trapdoor to a mage's laboratorium. There is a container with green gas near the ceiling. Inside they see 2 bodies and a single ghost on talking to her she tells them:

	"One day, peasants came to the island and broke into the tower to kill everyone there. Terrified by this, she drank a potion that the mage had given her, thinking it'd kill her. Instead, it was a strong paralyzing potion that put her in a deathlike slumber to make the peasants think she had killed herself, so they left after killing everyone else. However, when she awoke, she was still paralyzed and the rats ate her alive. "

She is cursed because when her lover Graham went into the tower with the villagers and he assumed she was dead. This made her hate her lover and she has to forgive him in order to reverse the curse.

3 options:

1.	Bring her remains to graham, when they meet he tells them he helped the villagers attack the tower and led them into a massacre. Because he wanted to save his love. He thanks them and asks for peace to bury her. When they walk away they hear a scream and when they run back they see a plague maiden (wraith?) and can kill it, or not but then they release her onto the world.
2.	Bring Graham to her, when they return with Graham the ghosts attack the party and blame him for the curse and attack. He was in the tower with his lover while the villagers were killed by the poison.
3.	Ignore it and attack, she can't be killed because of the curse, they need to switch to 1 or 2.

Poison trap: When they enter or leave the tower they see a contraption on the door. Activating it releases poison gas outside.
